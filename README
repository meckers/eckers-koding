   - Double click a folder in your file tree to view its contents.
   
   - Public files are located in:

     every file under that location can be viewed with URL
     "http://USERNAME.koding.com"

     is at http://USERNAME.koding.com/1.txt

   - Double-click on a file to open it within your editor.
   
   - Files within your "website" folder can be previewed by
     clicking the "Eye" icon next to the Save button on the
     upper-right side of this editor.
        
   - To create a new file, you can do one of the following:
       1. Click the "+" tab above this tab, and then click
          the "Save" button.
       2. Right-click your file tree, and choose "New File".
   
   - You can change the syntax format, font size, and many other
     options in the Settings button located at the bottom-right
     side of this editor.
   
   - Try opening one of the default files provided in your 
     "website" folder!
